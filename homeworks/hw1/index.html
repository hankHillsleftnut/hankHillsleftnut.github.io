<p>pAs a creative individual, I relish in exploring the world through a scientific lens. My ambition drives me to master the domains that spark my curiosity and I hold myself to the highest standards of excellence. This passion is reflected in my creative pursuits, such as fine art, architecture, and product/UX design.

    However, I understand that productivity and work are not the only things that matter in life. Music, particularly R&B and old school jazz, brings me immense joy. Cooking, and more importantly eating good food, is a hobby that brings me pleasure. You can find me at a comedy club, a YG concert, skiing down a mountain, or taking photos of breathtaking landscapes.
    
    I firmly believe that the relationships we build and the fun we have, and the things we make are the most important aspects of life. I am dedicated to creating the space to love my community and sustainably experience joy, and put my all into my creations as I continue to learn and grow.
